DeploymentStore — persistence layer for deployment control records.

Stores each deployment as a JSON file at:
    users/<client_id>/deployments/<project_id>.json

A single store instance is shared across all clients; caller supplies
client_id on every method call.

Uses IStore directly (not FileStore) because deployments are small structured
JSON, not user-uploaded binary data.
