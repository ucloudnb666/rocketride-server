Account package initialiser.

Bootstraps third-party dependencies declared in the local requirements.txt,
selects the correct Account implementation (SaaS vs. OSS), and re-exports
every symbol that downstream modules need from a single import point.

SaaS builds overlay the ``account/auth/`` subpackage at build time.  When that
subpackage is absent the open-source ``account/oss/`` implementation is used
instead so that the rest of the server code never needs to branch on which
edition is running.
