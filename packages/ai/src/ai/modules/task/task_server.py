TaskServer: Centralized Task Management and Orchestration Server.

This module implements a comprehensive task management system that orchestrates
computational task lifecycles through DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) over WebSocket
connections. It serves as the central hub for creating, managing, monitoring, and
cleaning up distributed computational tasks with full debugging and data processing
capabilities.

Primary Responsibilities:
--------------------------
1. Manages WebSocket connections for multiple concurrent DAP clients
2. Orchestrates task creation, execution, and termination with security controls
3. Provides task registry with API key-based access control and isolation
4. Handles task lifecycle management (launch, execute, attach, detach, stop)
5. Implements event broadcasting system for real-time task monitoring
6. Performs automatic cleanup of completed tasks to prevent memory leaks
7. Maintains comprehensive metrics and status reporting for monitoring
8. Ensures secure multi-tenant task isolation through authentication

Task Lifecycle Management:
-------------------------
- LAUNCH: Creates new tasks with debugging capabilities enabled
- EXECUTE: Creates new tasks for batch processing without debugging
- ATTACH: Connects clients to existing running tasks (multi-client support)
- DETACH: Disconnects clients from tasks while preserving task state
- STOP: Terminates tasks and performs resource cleanup

Security Features:
------------------
- API key-based task authentication prevents cross-tenant access
- Task token validation ensures only authorized clients can access tasks
- Secure task isolation with per-tenant resource management
- Connection tracking and audit logging for security monitoring

Architecture:
-------------
Central orchestration server managing:
- Task instances (computational workloads)
- DAP connections (debugging and control interfaces)
- Event broadcasting (real-time monitoring and notifications)
- Resource management (automatic cleanup and metrics)
- Multi-tenant security (API key isolation and access control)

        or due to network issues. The actual message processing is handled by
        the transport layer and TaskConn command handlers. Authentication is
        performed by TaskConn on the first DAP message (auth command), not on
        the WebSocket upgrade.
