TaskConn: Unified DAP Connection Handler for Task Management System.

This module implements a comprehensive DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) connection handler
that combines multiple command processing capabilities into a single unified interface.
It serves as the primary connection point for DAP clients to interact with computational
tasks, providing task lifecycle management, data processing, and event monitoring
through a single WebSocket connection.

Primary Responsibilities:
--------------------------
1. Provides a unified DAP interface combining task, data, and monitor commands
2. Manages WebSocket connections for DAP clients with complete protocol support
3. Routes DAP commands to appropriate specialized command handlers
4. Handles task lifecycle operations (launch, execute, attach, terminate)
5. Facilitates real-time data processing requests to running tasks
6. Manages event monitoring and subscription services
7. Provides connection management and transport layer integration
8. Delegates complex operations to backend task instances

Command Categories:
-------------------
- Task Commands: lifecycle management (launch, execute, attach, terminate, pause, continue)
- Data Commands: real-time data processing requests (ext_process)
- Monitor Commands: event subscription and monitoring (ext_monitor)
- Standard DAP: debugging protocol commands (initialize, breakpoints, etc.)

Architecture:
-------------
Uses multiple inheritance to combine specialized command handlers:
- TaskCommands: Task lifecycle and debugging session management
- DataCommands: Data processing request handling
- MonitorCommands: Event monitoring and subscription management
- DAPConn: Base DAP protocol implementation

This design provides a single connection point while maintaining separation
of concerns through specialized command handler classes.

    Unified DAP connection handler combining task management, data processing, and monitoring.

    This class serves as the primary interface for DAP clients to interact with the
    task management system. It combines multiple specialized command handlers through
    multiple inheritance, providing a comprehensive API for task operations while
    maintaining clean separation of concerns.

    Key Features:
    - Complete DAP protocol compliance with extended task management commands
    - Unified connection management for all task-related operations
    - Transport layer abstraction with callback-based event handling
    - Automatic command routing to appropriate specialized handlers
    - Connection lifecycle management with proper cleanup
    - Error handling and diagnostic logging across all command types

    Command Routing:
    - DAP standard commands (initialize, terminate, etc.) → specialized handlers
    - Task commands (launch, execute, attach) → TaskCommands mixin
    - Data commands (ext_process) → DataCommands mixin
    - Monitor commands (ext_monitor) → MonitorCommands mixin
    - Generic task commands → delegated to task instances

    Inheritance Hierarchy:
    - TaskCommands: Task lifecycle and debugging operations
    - DataCommands: Real-time data processing interface
    - MonitorCommands: Event subscription and monitoring
    - DebugCommands: Debugging session management
    - MiscCommands: Miscellaneous utility commands (services, etc.)
    - CProfileCommands: cProfile process profiling (start, stop, status, report)
    - AccountCommands: Account management (profile, keys, organizations, teams, billing)
    - AppCommands: App marketplace (developer, submission, catalog, admin, pricing)
    - DAPConn: Base DAP protocol implementation and transport handling

    Attributes:

        This enables standard DAP debugging commands (breakpoints, step, evaluate, etc.)
        to be forwarded directly to the task's debugging engine. This method is
        mainly used to forward commands on to the debugger.

        Args:
            request (Dict[str, Any]): DAP command request containing:
                - apikey: Authentication key for task access control
                - token: Unique identifier for the target task instance
                - command: DAP command type (step, breakpoint, evaluate, etc.)
                - arguments: Command-specific parameters and options

        Command Flow:
        1. Extract authentication credentials and task identification
        2. Locate the target task instance through server registry
        3. Forward the complete command request to task's request handler
        4. Return the task's response (handled by task's DAP implementation)

        Delegation Logic:
        - Commands handled by mixins (launch, ext_process, ext_monitor) bypass this method
        - Standard DAP commands (step, breakpoint, evaluate, etc.) are routed here
        - Task instances implement their own DAP command processing
        - This provides seamless integration with task-specific debugging engines

        Raises:
            Exception: If task lookup fails, authentication is invalid,
                      or command processing encounters errors

        Note:
        - This method assumes the task exists and is accessible with provided credentials
        - Error handling includes diagnostic logging before re-raising exceptions
        - The actual command processing logic resides in individual task instances
