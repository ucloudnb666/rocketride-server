Deploy API namespace for the RocketRide Python SDK.

Provides typed methods for managing server-side pipeline deployments via
``rrext_deploy_*`` DAP commands over the existing WebSocket connection.

Usage:
    deployment = await client.deploy.add(pipeline=my_pipeline, name='nightly-etl')
    deployments = await client.deploy.list()
    status = await client.deploy.status(deployment['deploymentId'])
    await client.deploy.update(deployment['deploymentId'], schedule={'mode': 'on_demand'})
    await client.deploy.remove(deployment['deploymentId'])
